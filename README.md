# Basic Data Structures in C
This repository contains basic data structures implemented in C. The data structures are implemented using arrays and linked lists. The data structures are: 
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph
* Hash Table

## Stack
A stack is a data structure that stores data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. The stack is implemented using an array. The following operations are supported:
* Push
* Pop
* Peek
* Is Empty
* Is Full

## Queue
A queue is a data structure that stores data in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. The queue is implemented using an array. The following operations are supported:
* Enqueue
* Dequeue
* Peek
* Is Empty
* Is Full

## Linked List
A linked list is a data structure that stores data in a sequential manner. The linked list is implemented using a linked list. The following operations are supported:
* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* Is Empty

## Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a data structure that stores data in a sorted manner. The binary search tree is implemented using a linked list. The following operations are supported:
* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* Is Empty

## Max Heap
A max heap is a data structure that stores data in a sorted manner. The max heap is implemented using an nodes. The following operations are supported:
* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* Find Min
* Root Node 
* Print In Order  (Left, Root, Right) 
* Print Pre Order  (Root, Left, Right)
* Print Post Order  (Left, Right, Root)

## Search and Sorting Algorithms
The following search and sorting algorithms are implemented:
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort

## Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that stores data in a hashed manner. The hash table is implemented using an array. The following operations are supported:
* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* Delete All

## Graph

A graph is a data structure that stores data in a node and edge manner. The graph is implemented using a linked list. The following operations are supported:
* Insert Node
* Insert Edge
* Delete Node
* Delete Edge
* Search Node
