# Basic Data Structures in C
This repository contains basic data structures implemented in C. The data structures are implemented using arrays and linked lists. The data structures are: 
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List
* Binary Search Tree
* Graph
* Hash Table

## Stack
A stack is a data structure that stores data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. The stack is implemented using an array. The following operations are supported:
* Push
* Pop
* Peek
* Is Empty
* Is Full

## Queue
A queue is a data structure that stores data in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. The queue is implemented using an array. The following operations are supported:
* Enqueue
* Dequeue
* Peek
* Is Empty
* Is Full

## Linked List
A linked list is a data structure that stores data in a sequential manner. The linked list is implemented using a linked list. The following operations are supported:
* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* Is Empty
